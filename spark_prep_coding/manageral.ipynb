    "### 🔍 What are **Late-Binding Views** in Amazon Redshift?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late-binding views** are special types of views in Redshift that **do not bind to the underlying database objects (like tables) at creation time**. Instead, they resolve those objects **only at query execution time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",

    "🧠 Why Use Late-Binding Views?\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard views:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Redshift checks if the referenced tables/columns exist **when the view is created**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*   If the underlying tables change (e.g., dropped, renamed, column type modified), **the view becomes invalid**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "In **late-binding views**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   View **does not break** even if the base tables are changed/dropped.\n",

    "✅ Use Case Example (Real-World)\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",

    "✅ 2. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Encapsulation is **bundling data and methods** together and **restricting direct access** to internal variables to protect data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.__salary = salary  # private variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_salary(self):\n",
    "        return self.__salary\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_salary(self, new_salary):\n",
    "        if new_salary > 0:\n",
    "            self.__salary = new_salary\n",
    "\n",
    "emp = Employee(\"Hari\", 50000)\n",
    "print(emp.get_salary())\n",
    "emp.set_salary(60000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Interview Tip:\n",

    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Polymorphism means **“many forms”** — the same method name can behave **differently** depending on the object calling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function using polymorphism\n",
    "def make_sound(animal):\n",
    "    animal.speak()\n",
    "\n",
    "make_sound(Cat())  # Meow\n",
    "make_sound(Dog())  # Woof\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Interview Tip:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Polymorphism helps in writing generic and reusable code. I used it in loggers where different handlers (File, S3, Console) implement a common log() method.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. **Inheritance**\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Inheritance allows a class to **inherit properties and methods** from another class (parent → child).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Vehicle started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):  # Inheriting from Vehicle\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car is driving\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car()\n",
    "my_car.start()  # Inherited method\n",
    "my_car.drive()  # Own method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Interview Tip:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Inheritance helps avoid code duplication. I use it in pipeline classes where a base ETL class handles logging and error handling, and child classes implement source-specific logic.\"\n",
